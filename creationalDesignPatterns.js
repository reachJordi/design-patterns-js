/*
Used to construct new objects
adapting creation to the situation

Constructor Patterns
Use to create new objects with their own object scope.
    - new keyword
        - Links to an object prototype
        - Binds 'this' to the new object scope
        - Implicitly returns this

Prototypes
An encapsulation of properties that an object links to.
